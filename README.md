# Ripple-Carry-Adder-Six-Bit-RCA6-
I designed a 6-bit ripple carry adder (RCA6_Bit) in Cadence Virtuoso, prioritizing both efficient and accurate computation. The project centered on creating a robust circuit capable of performing binary addition. To enhance its functionality, I strategically incorporated D flip-flops to attach a functional memory unit  to store the data.
